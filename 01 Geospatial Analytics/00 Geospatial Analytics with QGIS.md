# Overview

In this part of the course, you will learn the basics of working with the freely available geograph-ic information system QGIS. These course-related worksheets are intended to guide you through the individual exercises (“learning by doing”). The course slides include a basic introduction to geospatial information systems, their application, mapping, and various tools in QGIS (“Learning by Studying”). For your learning success, it is recommended to use both documents!

The following task sheets were deliberately written in detail to make it easier for you to do some follow-up work at home.

The following four exercise units contain different learning objectives (Some tasks are inspired by the exercises of the course "Logistiknetzwerke" by Dr. Maximilian Lukesch.):
- In **Task 1**, you create a map that shows the distribution of the population in the USA. You will learn how to read and edit data, format layers, and create maps.
- In **Task 2.1**, you create a map of Regensburg on which the Aldi branches are marked and in which you draw a circular route. You will learn a simple form of geocoding, creating point shapefiles, formatting points and lines, measuring distances, and creating line shapefiles.
- **Task 2.2** builds on the material from Task 2.1. They analyze the market reach of the Re-gensburg Aldi branches. Here you will learn how to use different geo tools (buffer, intersec-tion, dissolve), how to prepare attribute tables and how to calculate new attributes.
- In **Task 3**, you examine a fictitious distribution network in Bavaria. You will learn various analysis methods relevant to logistics, including the generation of centroids, distance matri-ces and Voronoi polygons, as well as the mapping and formatting of goods flows.

A few hints should be given for your further work with QGIS:
- QGIS is a powerful program – an introductory course only gives you a jump-start. Exploit-ing the possibilities of QGIS depends on your personal efforts in understanding and using the program.
- Search for freely available data and discover the potential of QGIS!
- The QGIS community is very active: you can almost always find an answer to your question by searching the web.
- QGIS has many plugins: There may be a plugin that can help you with your specific prob-lem! If in doubt, google your problem in English.
